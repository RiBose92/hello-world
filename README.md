# hello-world

I have decided to make the best of this lockdown and learn how to code software development languages. So far I have learnt the basics of HTML and CSS and I love what they can do on a webpage! I would like to start learning more of JavaScript and Python. 

I started out with taking on a 5 day Coding Challenge where I first learnt HTML, CSS and JS. Having the knowledge of Matlab from university and my placement really helped me pick up these languages quick.
